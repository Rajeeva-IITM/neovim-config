# Built with the help of ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

For my "workflow" and learning, I have added some LSPs for languages I use:
- Pyrefly for python
- Air for R 
- Tinymist for Typst

Apart from this I have done nothing else. Other than find out how to move from one window to another.
